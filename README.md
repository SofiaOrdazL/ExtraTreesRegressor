Estimating photometric redshifts of galaxies and quasars using ExtraTreesRegressor
Calculating the redshift of galaxies and quasars is fundamental in modern cosmology, providing crucial information about the expansion of the universe and the relative velocity of celestial objects. Since obtaining spectroscopic observations for a large number of galaxies can be difficult and expensive, the use of photometric redshifts is preferred. The use of machine learning techniques to estimate photometric redshifts has become a valuable resource in modern astronomy due to the large amount of data expected from upcoming astronomical senses.

There are currently machine learning algorithms that have been shown to be able to estimate photometric redshifts for values of (z < 1). In this work, the ExtraTreesRegressor algorithm from the ScikitLearn library is used to obtain estimates in the entire redshift range (0 < z < 7) offered by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) catalog using its Data Releases from 12 to 18, using preprocessing methods for data cleaning and recursive feature selection (RFE), a logarithmic domain to avoid class imbalance and a GridSearch to obtain the best hyperparameters for the model, evaluating it with the two most used metrics in machine learning algorithms, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and R^2.

After implementing resources to optimize the ExtraTreesRegressor model, it was not possible to obtain an MSE less than 2.050, which shows that the algorithm was not able to accurately estimate redshifts in the range (0 < z < 7). However, when performing the analysis for (z < 1), the MSE improved significantly to 0.052. In conclusion, the algorithm, with the detailed characteristics and parameters, only works effectively for values of (z < 1).
